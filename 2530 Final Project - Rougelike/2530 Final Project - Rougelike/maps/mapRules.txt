Map Rules

These are the rules for building maps for our project.

* At this point, only Mike has seen this, so only he has had input.  That can and will change.

1. Always edit the maps.xls file in Libreoffice Calc.  This allows the conditional formatting to work properly.
2. We need a way to draw maps bigger than the screen, so we can draw to a given window.
3. All rows need to be the number of columns.
4. Closed doors have an opening difficulty of their map value - 100.  //Unimplemented...
5. After editing a map, save the sheet as .csv file.

The integer codes for map objects are
0		open space	'.'
1		Wall		//Wall character...
2		Black Space ' '
3		Up stairs	'>'
4		Down stairs	'<'
100		Open Door	'-'
101-300 Closed door	'+'
