Map Rules

These are the rules for building maps for our project.

* This can and will change.

1. Always edit the maps.xls file in Libreoffice Calc.  This allows the conditional formatting to work properly.
2. The map must be at MOST 100 wide by 40 tall. (100, CV) (Let's call this standard size)
3. All rows need to be the number of columns.
4. Closed doors have an opening difficulty of their map value - 100.  //Unimplemented...
5. After editing a map, save the sheet as .csv file.
6. Messages can be 52 characters wide and 5 lines long.

The integer codes for map objects are

* Non-Trigger *
Value	Name		Character			Unicode
0		open space	'.'
1		Wall		//Wall character...	9618
2		Black Space ' '
3		Up stairs	'>'
